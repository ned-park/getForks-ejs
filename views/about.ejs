        <p>recipeFork was born out of a desire to improve the state of recipe sharing on the web.
            The current state of recipe sharing is one of chaos, millions of sites appear to have 
            recipes, and while decentralization is often a good thing it can make relocating the 
            particular dish made from some jumble of blogs a difficult prospect.  Editing, updating,
            and sharing recipes is also inconvenient as things currently stand.
        </p>
        <p>Admidst this muddle, recipeFork borrows some ideas from version control software to enable
            users to easily write, save, modify, share and fork recipes from other others.  While this 
            might sound complicated, what it means is that users can easily find their recipes in one 
            convenient (and searchable) spot online, and keep track of the original recipe along with 
            modifications they've made.
