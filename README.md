# Introduction

getForks is a new way of managing, sharing, updating, and creating recipes that brings the power and convenience of version control to recipe development without the complexity.

Since recipes are (generally) simpler than software, the complexities of version control are largely absent, while the advantages remain without requiring a significant learning curve.

getForks is still in early development, but a testing area is available to explore! Visit [https://getforks.herokuapp.com/](https://getforks.herokuapp.com/) to give it a try.
